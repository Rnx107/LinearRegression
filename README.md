# Gym Member Exercise Prediction

This project demonstrates machine learning models to analyze and predict gym member exercise patterns using Python.

## Project Structure
- `Prediction_using_function.ipynb` - Implementation using modular functions
- `Prediction_without_function.ipynb` - Direct implementation without functions

## Dependencies
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The project uses a gym members exercise tracking dataset accessed from:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sayande01/Kaggle_Notebooks/refs/heads/main/gym_members_exercise_tracking.csv`

## Features
- Data preprocessing using StandardScaler
- Neural Network implementation using PyTorch
- Data visualization using Matplotlib
- Both functional and non-functional programming approaches

## Usage
Open either notebook in Jupyter/Google Colab to:
1. Load and preprocess the gym member data
2. Train the prediction model
3. Visualize results

## Implementations
The project provides two different approaches:
1. Modular approach with functions for better code organization
2. Direct implementation for simpler understanding
